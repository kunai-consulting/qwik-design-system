# File Upload Research

## Research Links:
- [Ark UI File Upload](https://ark-ui.com/react/docs/components/file-upload)
- [MUI File Upload](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/#file-upload)
- [Kobalte File Upload] (https://kobalte.dev/docs/core/components/file-field)
- [Radix UI Progress Indicator](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/progress)

## Features:
- [ ] Single file upload
- [ ] Multiple file upload
- [ ] Drag and drop support
- [ ] File type validation

## Component Structure:
- Root
- Input
- Dropzone
- Trigger

## Keyboard Interactions:
- Space/Enter to activate upload
- Tab navigation
- Escape to cancel

## Attributes:
- role="button" (for dropzone)
- aria-invalid
- accept attribute for file types

## Use Cases:
- Profile picture uploads
- Document submission
- Media galleries
- Form attachments

## API Design:

### Root:
```typescript
interface PublicFileUploadProps {
  multiple?: boolean;
  accept?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
  onFilesChange$?: PropFunction<(files: FileInfo[]) => void>;
}
```

### FileInfo:
```typescript
interface FileInfo {
  name: string;
  size: number;
  type: string;
  lastModified: number;
  file: NoSerialize<File>;
}
```

## Known Issues:
- Large file handling performance

## Questions:
- Should we add maxSize validation in the core API?
- Do we need to provide size limitation checks based on provided configs?
- Would a progress indicator help clients for larger uploads?

## Features
- [ ] Toggle pressing state
- [ ] Change event handler
- [ ] Indicator logic
- [ ] Handle fallback state

## Component Structure

- Toggle.Root
- Toggle.On
- Toggle.Off

## Keyboard Interactions
- Space key to toggle
- Enter key to toggle

## Attributes
- aria-pressed
- data-pressed

## Use Cases
- Mute or unmute
- Bold in text editor
- Enable chunks visual on Qwik homepage

## CSS Considerations

None given this special scenario of a button element.

What's expected from the consumer:

- Using the `data-pressed` attribute for styling the pressed state
- Focus styles for keyboard navigation
- Transition properties for smooth state changes
- Consider size variants through CSS custom properties
- Respect user's reduced motion preferences

## API Design

Root:
- `pressed` -> boolean
- `bind:pressed` -> `Signal<boolean>`
- `disabled` -> boolean
- `bind:disabled` -> `Signal<boolean>`
- `onChange$` -> `() => void`

## Known Issues

- If using `asChild` with a non-button element (like `<div>`), the component internally *must* correctly implement all button behaviors (keyboard events, focusability, `role="button"`). Using it with inherently interactive elements like `<a>` is generally discouraged due to conflicting semantics and accessibility issues.

- The state prop name `pressed` (aligned with `aria-pressed`) has a different grammatical tense than state props like `open` (used in components like Collapsible). While conventional, this inconsistency requires clear documentation. (Mitigated for styling via `data-state` if adopted).

## Common Gotchas / Developer Considerations

- **`Toggle.Root` Renders the Button:** Unlike some component patterns where `Root` might be a non-interactive wrapper, `Toggle.Root` directly renders the interactive `<button>` element for simplicity and directness. Apply ARIA labeling (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`) and other button-specific attributes directly to `Toggle.Root`.

> **Rationale:** We made `Toggle.Root` the button element itself rather than a wrapper. This is more intuitive for developers, simplifies the API, and reduces unnecessary nesting that would be required with a separate `<Toggle.Trigger>` component.

- As a headless component, `Toggle` provides no visual styling by default. Consumers are responsible for all CSS, including base styles, pressed state styles, disabled styles, and **crucially, focus-visible styles** for accessibility.

- Consumers should leverage the `data-pressed` attribute for state-based styling.

## Questions

- What is the best way to document the `pressed` vs. `open` naming rationale to prevent developer confusion?

- Is a dedicated `Toggle.Label` component necessary, or can we rely on the consumer doing the right thing with `aria-labelledby` / `aria-label` practices? (Consider potential HTML streaming order challenges). Edit: No, we should not expose a `Toggle.Label` component.

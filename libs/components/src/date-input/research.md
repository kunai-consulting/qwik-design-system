## Research Links
Here are some resources that can inform and inspire our implementation

### Native HTML
Source: [MDN article on Date Input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)

Native HTML provides a date input element that can be used to select a date.

### Other libraries
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/DateField.html)
  - This component has a very pleasant user experience. It breaks the input into three parts: month, day, and year. 
  Each has a clear placeholder and the ability to increment/decrement the value using the up and down arrows.
- [flux Date Picker](https://fluxui.dev/components/date-picker)
  - The tech stack and API is quite different, but the input in this date picker works similarly to React Aria's DateField.

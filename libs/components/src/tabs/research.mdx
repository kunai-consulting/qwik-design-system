# Tabs Research



## Features
Target features. Some are essential, others are nice to have.
- [ ] Hover vs. click activation
- [ ] Horizontal and vertical orientation
- [ ] Support for disabled tabs
- [ ] Signal vs value based state management
- [ ] Callback for tab change/activation
- [ ] Add/remove tabs dynamically
- [ ] RTL support

## Component Structure
A potential structure for the Tabs component:

- Root (main container)
- List (container for the tab triggers)
- Trigger (the clickable tab element)
- Content (container for the content of a tab)
- Indicator (visual indicator of the active tab)

```tsx
<Tabs.Root>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger />
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Content />
</Tabs.Root>
```

## API

### Root

- `orientation` (horizontal, vertical)
- `onChange$` (callback for tab change/activation)
- `value` (current active tab value based)
- `bind:value` (current active tab value signal based)
- `loop` (loop through tabs)
- `selectOnFocus` (select the tab when focused)

### Native HTML / WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices
- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices - Tabs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/)

## Accessibility (ARIA)
Key ARIA attributes and roles to consider:
- `role="tablist"` on the container of tabs.
- `role="tab"` on each tab element.
- `role="tabpanel"` on each tab content element.
- `aria-selected` on the active tab.
- `aria-controls` on each tab, linking to its `tabpanel`'s ID.
- `aria-labelledby` on each `tabpanel`, linking to its tab's ID.
- `aria-orientation` for `tablist` if supporting vertical tabs.
- `aria-disabled` for disabled tabs.

## Keyboard Navigation
Standard keyboard interactions for tabs:
- `Tab`:
    - When focus is outside the tab list, `Tab` moves focus to the active tab.
    - When focus is on a tab, `Tab` moves focus to the active tab panel (if focus is meant to go into the panel) or the next focusable element outside the tab list.
- `Arrow Keys` (Left/Right for horizontal, Up/Down for vertical):
    - When focus is on a tab, these keys move focus to the previous/next tab.
    - Behavior for automatic vs. manual activation:
        - **Automatic activation**: Moves focus and activates the tab.
        - **Manual activation**: Moves focus only; user presses `Enter` or `Space` to activate.
- `Enter` or `Space`:
    - When focus is on a tab (in manual activation mode), activates the tab and its associated panel.
- `Home`:
    - When focus is on a tab, moves focus to the first tab. (Activates if automatic activation)
- `End`:
    - When focus is on a tab, moves focus to the last tab. (Activates if automatic activation)
- (Optional) `Delete` for deletable tabs.

## Open Questions
- Default activation mode (automatic or manual)?
- How to handle dynamic addition/removal of tabs smoothly?

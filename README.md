# Qwik Design System

> Better Design Systems at Scale

- 🌐 Runs in any environment (browser, server, etc)
- 🔍 Just-in-time code execution
- ♿ Fully accessible and tested across browsers and devices

Qwik Design System (QDS) is a next generation toolkit for creating Qwik apps of any size. It intends to be the foundation for design system authors, and is already being adopted in production by enterprise organizations.

It is currently in active development, and aims to provide:

- ✨ A component library of unstyled UI components (currently in development)
- 📚 A documentation framework that allows you to focus on content
- 🎨 A comprehensive icons library
- 📊 A powerful data visualization library (charts)
- 🧮 A flexible and accessible tables library

And much more, you can view our roadmap [here](https://qwik.design/contributing/intro/#roadmap).

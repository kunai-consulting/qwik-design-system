## Examples
### Basic Usage
The toast component can be implemented with minimal configuration using the `position` and `duration` props. The `position` prop determines where the toast appears on screen, while `duration` sets how long it remains visible.
<Showcase name="hero" />
In this example, we use:
- `Toast.Root` with `position="bottom-right"` and `duration={5000}` for positioning and timing
- `Toast.Content` to display the message
- `bind:open` prop for controlling visibility state
### Visual Features
#### Toast Positioning
Toasts can be positioned in six different locations on the screen using the `position` prop:
- `top-left`
- `top-right`
- `top-center`
- `bottom-left`
- `bottom-right`
- `bottom-center`

Each position value affects where the toast appears relative to the viewport edges.
### Advanced Usage
#### Multiple Toasts
Multiple toasts can be displayed simultaneously, each with its own position and timing. Each toast operates independently and can be controlled separately.

## Component State
### Using Component State
The Toast component's state can be controlled in two primary ways:
1. **Uncontrolled State**
Use the `open` prop to set the initial visibility state of the toast:
```tsx
<Toast.Root open={false}>
  <Toast.Content>Message</Toast.Content>
</Toast.Root>
```
2. **Controlled State**
For reactive control, use the `bind:open` prop with a boolean signal:
As shown in the hero example, you can control the toast's visibility state and respond to changes:
The example demonstrates:
- Using `bind:open` for two-way binding
- Setting `duration` for automatic closing
- Positioning with the `position` prop
Key state-related props:
- `open`: Sets initial visibility state
- `bind:open`: Enables controlled state management
- `duration`: Controls auto-dismiss timing (defaults to 5000ms)
- `position`: Determines toast placement (defaults to "bottom-right")
### State Interactions
The toast component provides several ways to interact with its state:
1. **Automatic Dismissal**
By default, toasts automatically dismiss after the specified `duration`. As shown in the hero example, setting `duration={5000}` will close the toast after 5 seconds.
2. **Manual Control**
You can manually control the toast's visibility:
```tsx
<button onClick$={() => (isOpen.value = true)}>Show</button>
<button onClick$={() => (isOpen.value = false)}>Hide</button>
<Toast.Root bind:open={isOpen}>
  <Toast.Content>Controlled toast</Toast.Content>
</Toast.Root>
```
3. **Multiple Toast Management**
As demonstrated in the hero example, multiple toasts can be managed independently:
- Each toast maintains its own state
- Toasts can have different positions and durations
- Toasts can be shown and hidden independently
The toast's state is reflected in its data attributes:
- `data-state`: Shows current visibility ("visible" | "hidden")
- `data-position`: Indicates current position on screen
These attributes can be used for styling or testing purposes.

Based on the provided implementation and examples, I'll document the Toast configuration options.
## Core Configuration
### Positioning
The Toast component supports six positioning options through the `position` prop on `Toast.Root`:
- `top-left`
- `top-right`
- `top-center`
- `bottom-left`
- `bottom-right` (default)
- `bottom-center`

As shown in the hero example above, the position can be set using the `position` prop:
```typescript
type ToastPosition =
  | "top-left"
  | "top-right"
  | "bottom-left"
  | "bottom-right"
  | "top-center"
  | "bottom-center";
```
### Duration
The `duration` prop controls how long the toast remains visible before automatically closing. The default duration is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).
- Set to `0` to disable auto-closing
- Values are in milliseconds
- Minimum recommended duration: 2000ms
- Maximum recommended duration: 10000ms
### State Management
The Toast component supports both controlled and uncontrolled state management:
1. **Uncontrolled**: Use the `open` prop for initial state
2. **Controlled**: Use the `bind:open` prop with a signal
> Note: When using `bind:open`, the duration timer will automatically clean up if the component unmounts.
## Advanced Configuration
### Multiple Toasts
The Toast system supports multiple simultaneous toasts, each requiring a unique `id`. When not provided, an ID is automatically generated using `crypto.randomUUID()`.
As shown in the hero example above, each toast operates independently with its own:
- Position
- Duration
- State management
- Animation timing
### Technical Constraints
1. **Positioning**: Toast positions are fixed relative to the viewport
2. **Stacking**: Multiple toasts in the same position stack in order of appearance
3. **Animation**: State changes trigger CSS transitions via the `data-state` attribute
4. **Cleanup**: Timeout handlers are automatically cleaned up on:
   - Component unmount
   - Duration changes
   - Manual close events

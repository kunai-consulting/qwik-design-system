# Intro to QDS

Welcome to the <Sparkles>Qwik Design System team </Sparkles>!

**Qwik Design System** is an open source framework for building *better design systems at scale* with Qwik. From here on out, we'll refer to it as QDS.

## What's Included

✨ **A component library of unstyled UI components**  
📚 **A documentation site** to showcase and explain components  
📝 **An automatic documenter** that generates the initial docs and API surface for each component. <br />
🔍 **A testing environment** for ensuring component quality and accessibility

### Coming Soon

🛠️ **A CLI tool** to help you get started with the framework  
🧰 **A set of utilities** specifically designed for building robust design systems

## Prerequisites

Before contributing to QDS, you should be familiar with:

- **[Qwik](https://qwik.dev/)** ⚡: basic understanding of Qwik's component model, reactivity system (e.g signals, stores), and tasks

> New to Qwik? Check out this talk by Shai Reznik: [Qwik - Behind The Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3psTl5wqdk)

> Still learning Qwik? Start tackling a couple of [free frontend mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?type=free) to get familiar with the framework.

Nice to haves:

- **Web Accessibility** ♿: Basic understanding of ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation patterns
- **Testing** 🧪: Familiarity with testing tools and strategies

## Our Tech Stack

QDS is built with the following technologies:

- **[Qwik](https://qwik.dev/)** ⚡: Our core framework for environment agnostic components
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** 🔒: For type safety and better developer experience
- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** 🚀: For fast development and optimized builds
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** 📝: For documentation with embedded components
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** 🧪: For unit and component testing
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** 🎭: For end-to-end testing
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** 🎨: For styling the documentation site itself
- **[Changesets](https://changesets-docs.vercel.app/en)** 📦: For versioning and changelog management



## Principle 1: Headless

A headless UI library is just the brains without the beauty - all the smart functionality with [zero styling](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/).

- You get the complex behaviors (keyboard navigation, accessibility)
- You add your own styles (colors, spacing, animations)

Think of it as LEGO instructions without dictating what colors to use! 🧩

## Initial component setup

1. Create a new component folder in the `libs/components/src` directory.
2. Create a new route folder in the `apps/docs/src/routes/` directory.
3. Export the component from the `libs/components/src/index.ts` file.
4. Add the component to the sidebar menu in the `apps/docs/src/routes/menu.md` file.

## Adding docs examples

Every routes folder contains a `examples` folder. This is the place to add new examples for the component.

To add a new example, create a new file in the `examples` folder, and create a Qwik component that does a default export.

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";

export default component$(() => {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
});
```

Then, consume this in the mdx file with the file name as the name of the example.

File tree:

```shell
apps/docs/src/routes/tree/examples/hero.tsx
```

How it looks in MDX:

```mdx
<Showcase name="hero" />
```

## When is a component ready?

A component is ready when it has:

- Research
- Documentation
- Examples
- Tests

### Research

Each folder should have a file called `research.md` or `research.mdx` that outlines the research that went into the component. This should include:

A comprehensive research document should cover the following areas:

#### 

#### Features

List all the features the component should support, using a checklist format:

```md
- [ ] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2
- [ ] Feature 3
```

#### Component Structure

Define the composition pieces of the component:

```md
Pieces:
- Root
- Panel
- Handle
```

#### Keyboard Interactions

Document all keyboard interactions the component should support for accessibility:

```md
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Enter/Space for activation
- Escape for dismissal
```

#### ARIA Attributes

List all the ARIA attributes needed for accessibility:

```md
role="dialog"
- aria-labelledby
- aria-describedby
```

#### Use Cases

Document common use cases for the component:

```md
- Forms
- Navigation
- Data visualization
```

#### CSS Considerations

Note any important CSS properties or techniques:

```md
Important CSS:
- position: absolute
- position-anchor: top-left
- overflow: hidden
```

#### API Design

Document the proposed API for each component part:

```md
Root:
- prop1 -> description
- prop2 -> description

Panel:
- propA -> description
- propB -> description
```

#### Known Issues

Document any known issues or challenges from similar implementations:

```md
- Edge case handling
- Browser inconsistencies
```

#### Questions

List any open questions that need resolution:

```md
- How should X behavior work?
- Should we support Y feature?
```

See the [resizable component research](libs/components/src/resizable/research.mdx) for an example.

## Roadmap

Qwik Design System is currently focused on providing a robust headless UI component library. Here's what we're planning for the future:

### Phase 1: Core Headless Components (Current)
- Building a comprehensive set of accessible, composable UI primitives
- Ensuring thorough documentation and examples
- Establishing testing patterns and best practices
- Utilities library to aid in building design systems

### Phase 2: Design System Tooling
- CLI for design system and docs setup
- Registry for adding both components and templates to consumer design systems
- Docs framework with batteries included search, headless sidebars, and more

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- Automated release process for soc2
- Analytics for tracking usage and adoption
- Bringing Auto API to each new design system

We welcome contributions at any stage of our roadmap! If you're interested in helping with a specific area, please check our [contribution guidelines](../contributing) or open an issue to discuss your ideas.

# Intro to QDS

<Image loading="eager" src={workshop} alt="QDS Workshop" />

Welcome to the <Sparkles>Qwik Design System team</Sparkles>!

**Qwik Design System** is an open source framework for building *better design systems at scale* with Qwik. From here on out, we'll refer to it as QDS.

## What's Included

✨ **A component library of unstyled UI components**  
📚 **A documentation site** to showcase and explain components  
📝 **An automatic documenter** that generates the initial docs and API surface for each component. <br />
🔍 **A testing environment** for ensuring component quality and accessibility

### Coming Soon

🛠️ **A CLI tool** to help you get started with the framework  
🧰 **A set of utilities** specifically designed for building robust design systems

## Prerequisites

Before contributing to QDS, you should be familiar with:

- **[Qwik](https://qwik.dev/)** ⚡: a basic understanding of Qwik's component model, reactivity system (e.g signals, stores), and tasks

> New to Qwik? Check out this talk by Shai Reznik: [Qwik - Behind The Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3psTl5wqdk)

> Still learning Qwik? Start tackling a couple of [free frontend mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?type=free) to get familiar with the framework.

Nice to haves:

- **Web Accessibility** ♿: Basic understanding of ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation patterns
- **Testing** 🧪: Familiarity with testing tools and strategies

## Our Tech Stack

QDS is built with the following technologies:

- **[Qwik](https://qwik.dev/)** ⚡: Our core framework for environment agnostic components
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** 🔒: For type safety and better developer experience
- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** 🚀: For fast development and optimized builds
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** 📝: For documentation with embedded components
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** 🧪: For unit and component testing
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** 🎭: For end-to-end testing
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** 🎨: For styling the documentation site itself
- **[Changesets](https://changesets-docs.vercel.app/en)** 📦: For versioning and changelog management

> We also use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Please enable the [Biome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) in VSCode to get the recommended rules and formatting.



## What is unstyled or headless ui?

A headless UI library is just the brains without the beauty - all the smart functionality with [zero styling](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/).

- You get the complex behaviors (keyboard navigation, accessibility)
- You add your own styles (colors, spacing, animations)

Think of it as LEGO instructions without dictating what colors to use! 🧩

## Roadmap

<Image src={roadmap} alt="QDS Roadmap" />

Qwik Design System is currently focused on providing a robust headless UI component library. Here's what we're planning for the future:

### Phase 1: Core Headless Components (Current)
- Building a comprehensive set of accessible, composable UI primitives
- An icons library that is automatically optimized via [OXVG](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg)
- Utilities library to aid in building design systems

### Phase 2: Design System Tooling
- CLI for design system and docs setup
- Registry for adding both components and templates to consumer design systems
- Docs framework with batteries included search, headless sidebars, and more
- A headless charts and tables library
- Qwik Motion, a performant animation library

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- Automated release process for soc2
- Analytics for tracking usage and adoption
- Bringing Auto API to each new design system

We welcome contributions at any stage of our roadmap! PR's are always welcome, and we are always happy to chat about new ideas.

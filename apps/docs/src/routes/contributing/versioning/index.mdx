# Versioning Packages

QDS is a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) that contains the source code for multiple packages on npm.

> This page explains how to version and publish a specific package in the QDS monorepo. It assumes you are already familiar with the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager.
## The versioning tool

[Changesets](https://changesets-docs.vercel.app/en) is a versioning and changelog management tool designed for multi-package repositories like QDS.

It allows contributors to declare how their changes should be released while automating version bumps, changelog updates, and package publishing across interdependent packages.

## Doing a release

To do a release, there needs to be at least one changeset that is merged into the main branch.

There is a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/qwik-design-system/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) that will check for changesets and create a release pull request.

### Creating a changeset

To create a changeset, you need to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

After running the command, you'll see a vertical rounded checklist:

<Image src={changesetPrompt} alt="Changeset prompt" />

You can navigate the checklist using the arrow keys and select the packages you want to include in the changeset using the `space` key.

<Image src={packageSelected} alt="Package selected" />

In this case, imagine you have made some changes to the `@kunai-consulting/core` package.

The next step is to select the version type for the changeset. You can choose from the following types:

- `major`: A major version bump (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0) => **Library Wide Breaking changes**
- `minor`: A minor version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0) => **New features, breaking changes or bug fixes**
- `patch`: A patch version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1) => **Bug fixes, security patches, or other non-breaking changes**

**DO NOT** choose ðŸš¨ `major` ðŸš¨ unless you are sure the changes are library wide and breaking.

The UI for this is admittedly quite confusing. **To skip the current type, you can press `enter` to continue.**

#### IMPORTANT: SKIPPING THE CURRENT TYPE ðŸš¨

To skip the current type, you can press `enter` to continue. To select the current type, you can press `space` to select it.

<Image src={versionType} alt="Version type" />

In the case above, the enter key was pressed three times to skip to the `patch` type.

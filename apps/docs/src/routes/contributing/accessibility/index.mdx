# Accessibility

<Image src={accessibility} alt="Accessibility" />

**The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** requires applications to be accessible to people with disabilities. Following accessibility best practices helps:

- Make your components and API's usable by everyone
- Meet legal requirements
- Support consumers who rely on assistive technologies

## Accessibility in Qwik

Most accessibility features in Qwik work through standard HTML attributes rendered on the server. The main considerations are:

### Example 1: State Management and Updates

```tsx
const isOpen = useSignal(false);

return (
  <>
    <button 
      onClick$={() => isOpen.value = true}
      aria-expanded={isOpen.value}
    >
      Toggle Menu
    </button>
    <div 
      aria-hidden={!isOpen.value}
      aria-live="polite"
    >
      Content
    </div>
  </>
);
```

### Example 2: Refs

Signals in Qwik are also refs.  This means that you can use a signal to manage the ref for an element.

The ref value becomes the DOM element when it is resolved on the client.

```tsx
const triggerRef = useSignal<HTMLButtonElement>();

return (
    <button ref={triggerRef}>
       <Slot />
    </button>
)
```

#### Merging refs

The `ref` attribute can also accept a function, with the first argument being the element when resolved on the client.

This can be useful when consumers of your component provide a ref to the component.

```tsx
return (
    <button ref={(el) => {
        context.triggerRef = el;
        
        if (props.ref) {
            props.ref.value = el;
        }
    }}>
        <Slot />
    </button>
)
```

> The ref function can also be used for other more complex use cases, such as handling an array of refs.

### Example 3: Multiple Instances

**Do not use `querySelector` or `getElementById` to get an element in the DOM.**  Instead, use **refs and ref values.**

In an earlier section, we mentioned how ref values resolve to a DOM element on the client.

If only one instance of a piece is needed, e.g one trigger or content for an item, the ref can be placed in the root component in context.

If there are multiple instances, e.g. multiple triggers or content for an item, then an array of refs can be used.

For example, imagine you have a carousel of slides, and you want to manage when each slide is shown or hidden.

Inside root: 
```tsx
  const slideRefsArray = useSignal<Array<Signal>>([]);

  const context = {
    slideRefsArray
  }

  useContextProvider(carouselContextId, context);
```

Inside the item component:

```tsx
  const slideRef = useSignal<HTMLDivElement>();

  useTask$(function getIndexOrder() {
    if (index !== undefined) {
      context.slideRefsArray.value[index] = slideRef;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Qwik UI: Carousel Slide cannot find its proper index.');
    }
  });
```

The slide ref is defined directly in the item piece, this is because the item component is rendered multiple times, and we need to manage the ref for each instance.

Then, the slide refs array is updated with the ref for the current item.

Now throughout the component, we can use the slide refs array to manage actions for each slide.

```tsx
const handleDragSnap = $(async () => {
    if (!context.scrollerRef.value) return;

    const slides = context.slideRefsArray.value;
    const currentPosition = -transformSig.value[direction];

    let closestIndex = 0;
    let minDistance = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
      const slide = slides[i].value;
      if (!slide) continue;

      const slidePosition = await getSlidePosition(i);
      const distance = Math.abs(slidePosition - currentPosition);

      if (distance < minDistance) {
        closestIndex = i;
        minDistance = distance;
      }
    }

    const dragSnapPosition = await getSlidePosition(closestIndex);

    await setTransition(true);
    transformSig.value[direction] = -dragSnapPosition;
    await setTransform();

    context.currentIndexSig.value = closestIndex;
    isMouseDownSig.value = false;
    isMouseMovingSig.value = false;
    isTouchMovingSig.value = false;
    isTouchStartSig.value = false;
    window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
  });
```



### Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`) OR the equivalent with ARIA attributes
- Add ARIA attributes directly in your JSX
- Leverage Qwik's fine-grained reactivity to ensure screen readers announce state changes

## Testing for Accessibility

To ensure your Qwik.js applications are accessible, consider the following testing strategies:

### Automated Accessibility Testing   
This should be the first step in testing your application for accessibility. Automated testing tools can help identify accessibility issues with minimal effort.

- Use a linter to detect issues early in the development process. (e.g. axe DevTools Linter)
- Use a browser extension to test for accessibility issues. (e.g. Lighthouse, axe DevTools, WCAG Contrast Checker)
- Use a testing framework to automate accessibility testing. (e.g. Playwright, Vitest)

### Manual Accessibility Testing
Manual testing should not be skipped. It is beneficial to test using different platforms and devices and review and fix any issues that automated testing may have missed.  While pairing of screen readers and browsers is outside the scope of this guide, it is important to note that there are screen readers that work better with certain browsers and platforms.  
- Test with keyboard navigation initially.  
	- Make sure all interactive elements are focusable using just the keyboard. 
	- Note any elements that are skipped or out of order.  
	- Confirm that modals and other dynamically loaded content trap focus as necessary and return it correctly when closed.
- Test with screen readers.  
	- Use screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to navigate and interact with your application.  
	- Note any issues or areas that may be difficult to navigate.  
	- As with keyboard only navigation, confirm that modals and other dynamically loaded content trap focus as necessary and return it correctly when closed and that the screen reader announces the changes properly.

### Cross-Platform Accessibility Testing
Testing accessibility across multiple platforms and devices is essential to ensure your application is accessible to all users.  A good testing strategy involves multiple platforms and devices to ensure that your application is accessible to many different kinds of users.  This section provides guidance on how to conduct cross-platform accessibility testing.  
_Note: This section does not replace automated and manual testing, it is in addition to those methods._
- Test with key platforms, devices and assistive technologies.
   - __Windows:__ NVDA, JAWS, Narrator.  These are widely used screen readers for Windows. JAWS is a proprietary screen reader for Windows and has an associated cost, NVDA and Narrator are free and open source making accessibility testing easier.
   - __Mac:__ VoiceOver is the proprietary screen reader for Mac and iOS (iPhones, iPads, and iPods). 
   - __Android:__ Talkback is the screen reader for Android devices.  

- Establish a Testing Plan
    The testing plan should be repeatable and include the following steps:
	- Prioritize a browser screen reader pairing for initial development and testing.  This will provide a baseline for the application and help identify any accessibility issues early in the development process.  Continued testing with this pair will allow you to predict and address many issues that may arise.
	- Document your findings.  Note the browser, screen reader and operating system used.  If there are multiple pages or sections to the application, note the page or section.  If there are multiple issues, note the issue and how it was resolved.
	- Repeat on other platforms and devices.  Many users access applications on mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets.  These devices may have different screen sizes, resolutions, and operating systems and many are touch-based, meaning they may not be able to use the keyboard.  Testing on these devices can reveal issues not found on desktops or laptops.  Choose your secondary browser screen reader pairing and repeat the testing plan. Continue this process until you have tested on all platforms and devices you have access to.

- Continuous process
   - Accessibility testing should be an ongoing process.  It should be integrated into your development workflow and should be performed regularly.  Ensuring that the application is accessible to all users may be an initial goal, but a more realistic goal is to test on a regular basis, learn from the results and continue to improve the application.  Solving one accessibility issue on one platform and device could unintentionally impact another platform or device.  Continuous testing will help you identify and address these issues.

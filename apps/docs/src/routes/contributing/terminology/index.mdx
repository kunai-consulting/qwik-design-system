# Terminology

Our components are built from smaller pieces, and these pieces have consistent names. Knowing these names helps you understand how the components work. You can often find these pieces in the code by looking for attributes like `data-qds-[component]-[part]` (for example, `data-qds-checkbox-trigger`).

## Root

The `Root` is the main box or container for a component. It holds the settings and manages how the component works. It's the outer shell.

**Example:** `<Checkbox.Root>` holds all the other parts of a checkbox.

## Trigger

The `Trigger` is the part you click or interact with to make something happen, like showing or hiding content, or changing the component's state. It's usually a button.

**Example:** The button you click to open a `<Dropdown.Content>`, or the part you click inside of a `<Checkbox.Root>` or `<Switch.Root>`.

*Note:* For the simple `<Toggle />` button, the `Root` *is* the trigger because there aren't other pieces like a dropdown menu.

## Content

The `Content` is the area where the main information or visual part of the component is shown. This is especially used for parts that can appear or disappear.

**Example:** The popup that shows up from a `<Dropdown.Trigger>`, the section that opens up in a `<Collapsible.Trigger>`, or the scrollable part inside a `<ScrollArea.Root>`.

For floating components (above the page), the `Content` uses a special browser feature (Popover API) to appear on top of everything else. For others (like Collapsible), it just appears normally on the page.

## Item

An `Item` is one thing in a list or group within a component.

**Example:** One choice in a `<RadioGroup.Root>` (like `<RadioGroup.Item>`), one checkbox line in a `<Checklist.Root>` (`<Checklist.Item>`), or one branch in a `<Tree.Root>` (`<Tree.Item>`).

## Indicator

The `Indicator` is a visual sign showing the component's current status (like if it's checked, selected, or something in between).

**Example:** The check mark inside a `<Checkbox.Root>`, the dot inside a chosen `<RadioGroup.Item>`, or the little marker showing the position on a `<Slider.Root>`. Indicators often have special data tags like `data-checked`.

> Each indicator also takes a prop called `fallback`, jsx that can be passed when the indicator is not visible.

## Label

The `Label` is the text name or title for a component, like you'd see next to a checkbox or input field. It helps explain what the component is for and makes it easier to use, especially for screen readers.

**Example:** The text next to a `<Checkbox.Root>` or `<RadioGroup.Root>`.

## Description

The `Description` is extra text that gives more detail or instructions about a component. It often appears near a `Label`.

**Example:** Helpful text under an input field explaining what kind of information to enter.

## ErrorMessage

The `ErrorMessage` should only show up when something is wrong, like if you forget to fill out a required field. It only appears when there's an error.

**Example:** Text like "This field is required" showing up next to an empty input field.

We purposely leave the addition of error messages to the developer, to allow integration with any validation or form library.

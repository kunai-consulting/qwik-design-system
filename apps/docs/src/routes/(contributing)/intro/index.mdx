# Contributing to Qwik Design System

Qwik Design System provides headless UI components for building design systems at scale with Qwik.

Before contributing to the Qwik Design System, you should be familiar with:

- **[Qwik](https://qwik.dev/)** ⚡: Understanding of Qwik's component model, reactivity system, and optimization techniques

> Still learning Qwik? Start tackling a couple of [free frontend mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?type=free) to get familiar with the framework.

Nice to haves:

- **Web Accessibility** ♿: Basic understanding of ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation patterns
- **Component Design** 🧩: Familiarity with composable component patterns
- **Testing** 🧪: Familiarity with testing strategies for UI components

## Our Tech Stack

The Qwik Design System is built with the following technologies:

- **Qwik** ⚡: Our core framework for building resumable applications
- **TypeScript** 🔒: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite** 🚀: For fast development and optimized builds
- **MDX** 📝: For documentation with embedded components
- **Vitest** 🧪: For unit and component testing
- **Playwright** 🎭: For end-to-end testing
- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨: For styling the documentation site itself
- **Changesets** 📦: For versioning and changelog management



## Principle 1: Headless

A headless UI library is just the brains without the beauty - all the smart functionality with [zero styling](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/).

- You get the complex behaviors (keyboard navigation, accessibility)
- You add your own styles (colors, spacing, animations)

Think of it as LEGO instructions without dictating what colors to use! 🧩

## Principle 2: Composability

Composability means building complex UIs from simple, reusable pieces that work well together.

For example, instead of a single `<Tooltip>` component with many props, you get:

```jsx
<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger>Hover me</Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Tooltip.Content>I appear on hover!</Tooltip.Content>
</Tooltip.Root>
```

This approach gives you more control and flexibility.

Without composability, you face "prop armageddon":

```jsx
<Tooltip
  content="I appear on hover!"
  triggerText="Hover me"
  triggerProps={{ className: "btn", disabled: false }}
  triggerClass="text-blue"
  contentBackgroundColor="#333"
  contentClass="p-2 rounded"
  position="top"
  arrow={true}
  arrowSize={8}
  delay={200}
  // ...and 20 more props
/>
```

This pattern is better for those consuming the library, but not for those building it.

### Composing by abstraction

The purpose of these primitives is for consumers to abstract the complexity of the component, so you can focus on building your app.

```jsx
export const HelpTip = component$(({ trigger }) => {
  return (
    <Tooltip.Root>
      <Tooltip.Trigger asChild>
        {trigger}
      </Tooltip.Trigger>
      <Tooltip.Content class="help-bubble">
        <Slot />
      </Tooltip.Content>
    </Tooltip.Root>
  );
});

<form>
  <label>
    Username
    <HelpTip trigger={<Icon name="question-circle" />}>
      Choose a username between 3-20 characters
    </HelpTip>
  </label>
  <input name="username" />
</form>
```

### Composing with your own elements

With the `asChild` prop, you can even replace our default elements with your own:

```jsx
<Tooltip.Root>
  <Tooltip.Trigger asChild>
    <button class="my-custom-button"> 
      Hover me <Icon name="info" />
    </button>
  </Tooltip.Trigger>
  <Tooltip.Content>I appear on hover!</Tooltip.Content>
</Tooltip.Root>
```

This lets you maintain your component structure while still getting all the built-in behavior.

## Initial component setup

1. Create a new component folder in the `libs/components/src` directory.
2. Create a new route folder in the `apps/docs/src/routes/` directory.
3. Export the component from the `libs/components/src/index.ts` file.
4. Add the component to the sidebar menu in the `apps/docs/src/routes/menu.md` file.

## Adding docs examples

Every routes folder contains a `examples` folder. This is the place to add new examples for the component.

To add a new example, create a new file in the `examples` folder, and create a Qwik component that does a default export.

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";

export default component$(() => {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
});
```

Then, consume this in the mdx file with the file name as the name of the example.

File tree:

```shell
apps/docs/src/routes/tree/examples/hero.tsx
```

How it looks in MDX:

```mdx
<Showcase name="hero" />
```

## When is a component ready?

A component is ready when it has:

- Research
- Documentation
- Examples
- Tests

### Research

Each folder should have a file called `research.md` or `research.mdx` that outlines the research that went into the component. This should include:

A comprehensive research document should cover the following areas:

#### 

#### Features

List all the features the component should support, using a checklist format:

```md
- [ ] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2
- [ ] Feature 3
```

#### Component Structure

Define the composition pieces of the component:

```md
Pieces:
- Root
- Panel
- Handle
```

#### Keyboard Interactions

Document all keyboard interactions the component should support for accessibility:

```md
- Arrow keys for navigation
- Enter/Space for activation
- Escape for dismissal
```

#### ARIA Attributes

List all the ARIA attributes needed for accessibility:

```md
role="dialog"
- aria-labelledby
- aria-describedby
```

#### Use Cases

Document common use cases for the component:

```md
- Forms
- Navigation
- Data visualization
```

#### CSS Considerations

Note any important CSS properties or techniques:

```md
Important CSS:
- position: absolute
- position-anchor: top-left
- overflow: hidden
```

#### API Design

Document the proposed API for each component part:

```md
Root:
- prop1 -> description
- prop2 -> description

Panel:
- propA -> description
- propB -> description
```

#### Known Issues

Document any known issues or challenges from similar implementations:

```md
- Edge case handling
- Browser inconsistencies
```

#### Questions

List any open questions that need resolution:

```md
- How should X behavior work?
- Should we support Y feature?
```
